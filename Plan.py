What I want to do:

1. Create a counter
2. Put in the pattern
3. start the counter
4. Update the counter as I go, with feedback from the counter (prints position in pattern, next stage of pattern, sound effects etc)
5. Counter saves locally as we go?
6. Counter ends

Development plan:
1. Create basic while loop (tick!)
2. Create class that can be instantiated that runs this basic loop (tick!)

- Create counter class?? Separate to "stitch tracker" class, so I can have multiple counters for rows and stitches
- How to ingest pattern? csv? json? manually?
- How to save progress?
- More efficient way to implement while loop?
- Sound effects?
